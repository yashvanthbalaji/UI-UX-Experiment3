Heuristic Evaluation of Competing E-Commerce Platforms: Amazon vs. Flipkart
## Aim:
To evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of Amazon and Flipkart using Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, identify major usability issues, rate their severity, and propose design improvements to enhance user satisfaction and shopping efficiency.
## Algorithm:
1. Selected Amazon and Flipkart mobile apps for analysis.

2. Performed key user tasks:

   Sign up / Login

   Search for a product

   Apply filters and sort options

   Add to cart / wishlist

   Proceed to checkout

   Track or cancel orders

3. Evaluated each task using Nielsen’s 10 heuristics.

4. Rated problems on a 0–4 severity scale (0 = none, 4 = usability catastrophe).

5. Prioritized issues by Severity × Frequency × Impact.

6. Proposed targeted design fixes.

## Heuristic Evaluation — Issues & Fixes:
| **Heuristic**                                               | **Amazon**                                                          | **Flipkart**                                                 | **Notes / Comparison**                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Visibility of System Status**                          | Excellent: Real-time order tracking, loading indicators, cart count | Good: Some lag in status updates                             | Amazon gives clearer, more timely feedback           |
| **2. Match Between System & Real World**                    | Excellent: Familiar icons, natural product categories               | Good: Occasional jargon in offers (e.g., “SuperCoins”)       | Amazon uses more universally understandable language |
| **3. User Control & Freedom**                               | Good: Easy to remove from cart, cancel, or edit addresses           | Average: Returns/cancellations harder to find                | Amazon offers better reversal options                |
| **4. Consistency & Standards**                              | Excellent: Uniform layout across web and app                        | Good: Design slightly inconsistent between app versions      | Amazon more stable in design patterns                |
| **5. Error Prevention**                                     | Good: Confirmation before payments and deletions                    | Average: Mis-taps during offers can trigger unwanted actions | Amazon stronger in preventing accidental actions     |
| **6. Recognition Rather Than Recall**                       | Excellent: Recently viewed, auto-suggest search                     | Good: Too many promotional banners crowd recall              | Amazon better at surfacing relevant history          |
| **7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use**                      | Excellent: Voice search, saved addresses, one-click buy             | Good: Fast filters but slower navigation                     | Amazon suits both novice and power users             |
| **8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**                        | Good: Dense but structured                                          | Average: Overloaded with discount visuals                    | Flipkart sacrifices clarity for aggressive marketing |
| **9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose & Recover from Errors** | Good: Clear refund / failed payment messages                        | Average: Generic “try again later” errors                    | Amazon handles errors more transparently             |
| **10. Help & Documentation**                                | Good: In-app help and chatbot                                       | Good: FAQ page accessible                                    | Roughly equal, but Amazon’s help is faster to access |
